ingredients:
  - 2 pounds brussels sprouts rinsed and halved
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - salt and pepper
  - toasted pinenuts for serving if desired
  - parmesan cheese for serving if desired
  - Â½ cup balsamic vinegar
  - 1-2 tablespoons light brown sugar
steps:
  - Add brussels sprouts and olive oil to a slow cooker. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
  - Cover and cook on low for 3-4 hours or on high for 1-2 hours or until tender.
  - While the brussels sprouts are cooking make the balsamic reduction. (I make it about 30 minutes before the brussels sprouts are done)
  - Add balsamic vinegar and brown sugar to a small saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes or until the sauce has reduced by half. Keep warm until ready to use.
  - When the brussels sprouts are ready drizzle with the balsamic reduction and serve immediately with pine nuts and parmesan cheese, if desired.
