ingredients:
  - 1 to 1 1/2 pounds boneless
  - skinless chicken thighs
  - 1 large onion (diced)
  - 3 cloves garlic (minced)
  - 1-inch piece whole ginger (peeled and grated)
  - 2 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 1 to 2 tablespoons garam masala
  - 2 teaspoons paprika
  - 2 teaspoons kosher salt
  - 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes
  - 3/4 cup heavy cream or coconut milk
  - Fresh cilantro
  - chopped
  - 2 cups cooked rice
  - to serve
steps:
  - Cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces and transfer them to a 3-quart or larger slow cooker. Stir in the onion, garlic, ginger, tomato paste, 1 tablespoon of garam masala, paprika, and kosher salt until the chicken is evenly covered with spices. Stir in the diced tomatoes with their juices.
  - If you have the time - Marinate the chicken in 1/2 cup yogurt for up to 6 hours. Shake to remove excess yogurt before transferring to the slow cooker.
  - If you have the time - Saut√© the onions and garlic in a little olive oil over medium-high heat in a skillet until softened, then stir in the ginger, tomato paste, and spices until fragrant. Transfer to the slow cooker with the chicken and diced tomatoes. This will give your tikka masala more depth of flavor.
  - Cover the slow cooker and cook for 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low. Fifteen minutes before the end of cooking, stir in the heavy cream. If you prefer a thicker sauce, leave the slow cooker uncovered for the last 15 minutes. Taste and add more garam masala or salt to taste.
  - Serve over rice with fresh cilantro sprinkled over the top of each serving. The tikka masala can be refrigerated for 3 to 4 days or frozen for 3 to 4 months.
