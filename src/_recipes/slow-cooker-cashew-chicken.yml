ingredients:
  - 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts (About 4 pieces)
  - 3 Tablespoons Cornstach
  - 1/2 tsp black pepper
  - 1 Tbsp canola oil
  - 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
  - 4 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
  - 4 Tablespoons ketchup

  - 1 cup cashews
steps:
  - Combine cornstarch and pepper in resealable food storage bag. Add chicken. Shake to coat with cornstarch mixture.
  - Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken about 2 minutes on each side. Place chicken in slow cooker.
  - Combine soy sauce, vinegar, ketchup, sweet chili sauce sugar, garlic, ginger, pepper flakes, and cashews in small bowl; pour over chicken. (I like my cashews to be softer so I add them during the cooking process, if you want more of a crunch, add them right before serving)
  - Cook on LOW for 3 to 4 hours.
  - Serve over rice. Makes 4-6 servings.
