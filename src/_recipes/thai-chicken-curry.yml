ingredients:
  - 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed
  - ¼ cup Thai red curry paste (ideally one with makrut lime, lemongrass and shrimp paste)
  - 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
  - 2 Thai or serrano chiles, thinly sliced, or to taste
  - 1 pound ground chicken
  - ½ teaspoon dark brown sugar
  - 2 teaspoons fish sauce
  - ¼ teaspoon freshly grated lime zest, or 10 makrut lime leaves, deveined and thinly sliced
  - Rice, sliced cabbage, chopped herbs, sliced avocado, chopped cucumber and fried egg, for serving
steps:
  - In a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, warm the oil and toast the curry paste, turmeric and chiles (if using) until extremely fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir and lower heat as needed to prevent sticking.
  - Add the chicken and cook, breaking the meat up with a spoon. Stir to coat the meat in the curry paste and to prevent sticking, and cook until the chicken is opaque, 7 to 10 minutes. If everything is sticking, don’t panic — just add a little water or neutral oil.
  - Stir in the brown sugar, fish sauce and lime zest, and cook just until the liquid’s been absorbed, about 1 minute. Season to taste with more brown sugar and fish sauce. (The chicken should be spicy first, salty second.) Serve at once with desired toppings.
