ingredients:
  - 2 ounces bourbon
  - 2/3 ounce lemon juice
  - 1 teaspoon superfine sugar
  - cocktail glass
steps:
  - Shake the bourbon, juice, and sugar well with cracked ice, then strain into a chilled cocktail glass (unless you happen to have a Sour glass).
  - Resist, if you can, the impulse to decorate lavishly with fruit, although a maraschino cherry will raise no eyebrows.
