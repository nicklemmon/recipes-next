ingredients:
  - 1 cup lentils, washed and picked over
  - 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
  - 1/3 medium onion, chopped
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 carrot, diced
  - 1 stalk of celery, diced
  - Salt to taste
  - 1 14-ounce can chopped tomatoes, with juice
  - 5 cups water
  - A bouquet garni made with 2 sprigs rosemary and 1 bay leaf
  - Freshly ground pepper to taste
  - Grated Parmesan or Gruyère for serving
  - 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley
steps:
  - Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a heavy soup pot or Dutch oven, and add the onion. Cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, carrot and celery, and a generous pinch of salt, and continue to cook for another 5 minutes until tender.
  - Add the tomatoes and bouquet garni, and cook, stirring often, until the tomatoes have cooked down somewhat and smell fragrant, about 10 minutes.
  - Add the lentils, water and salt to taste. Bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer gently one hour. Taste and adjust seasonings.
  - Remove the bouquet garni, and stir in the parsley. Serve, garnishing each bowl with Parmesan or Gruyère.
