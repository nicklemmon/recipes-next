  - 1/2 cup white wine
  - 1 (10.75 oz) can condensed golden mushroom soup

  - Preheat oven to 325 degrees
  - In a large saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Stir in the package of dressing mix. Blend in wine and golden mushroom soup. Mix in cream cheese and stir until smooth. Heat through, but do not boil. Arrange chicken breasts in a single layer in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour sauce over.
