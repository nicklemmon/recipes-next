ingredients:
  - 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes
  - ¾ cup chicken or vegetable broth, plus more as needed
  - 1 large yellow onion, coarsely chopped
  - tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 1 ½ teaspoons dried oregano
  - 1 teaspoon granulated sugar
  - Salt and black pepper
  - Mayonnaise
  - 8 slices brioche or milk bread, crusts removed
  - 1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella (4 ounces)
  - ¼ teaspoon dried oregano
  - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

steps:
  - Dump the canned tomatoes and their juices into a medium pot and using your hands, tear into coarse chunks. Swish the broth in the empty tomato can and add to the pot.
  - Stir in the onion, butter, oregano and sugar and season generously with salt and pepper. Turn the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until the onion is tender and the tomatoes have broken down, 15 to 20 minutes.
  - Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on one side of each slice of bread and evenly sprinkle the cheese and a little oregano on the mayonnaise side of 4 slices. Top with the cheeseless slices, mayonnaise-side down.
  - Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium. Add the sandwiches and cook until golden brown on the bottoms, 2 to 3 minutes. Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in the pan, then flip the sandwiches with a spatula, move them around to coat with the butter and cook until the other side is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn heat to lowest setting to keep sandwiches warm.
  - Carefully purée the tomato soup using a blender until smooth and creamy, adding more broth if needed to loosen to your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the grilled cheeses to a cutting board and cut each in half diagonally. Serve alongside the soup.
