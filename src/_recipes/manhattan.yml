ingredients:
  - 2 ounces rye whiskey
  - 1 ounce italian vermouth
  - 2 dashes Angostura Bittters
  - 1 cocktail glass
steps:
  - Stir the rye, vermouth and bitters well with cracked ice. (Some prefer to shake their Manhattans. There's nothing wrong with that, really, at least no more than putting ketchup on a hot-dog is wrong or mayonnaise on a corned beef sandwich. If you like your Manhattan cloudy and topped with an algae-like foam, shake away. It won't taste any worse, anyway, although it'll feel thinner on the tongue.)
  - Strain into in a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with twist or, of course, maraschino cherry (which is subject to the same challenge regarding purity as adding an olive to a martini).
