ingredients:
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 2 bell peppers of any color, diced
  - 1 yellow onion, chopped
  - 1 cup vegetable broth or water
  - 2 15 oz cans of black beans
  - 1 15 oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with their juices
  - 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice
  - 1 teaspoon chili powder
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
steps:
  - Select the saute function on your pressure cooker. In the inner cooking pot, heat the olive oil. Add the peppers and onion and saute until softened, 3 to 5 minutes
  - Add the broth, black beans, tomatoes, lime juice, chili powder and salt
  - Lock the lid in place. Select the soup function if your pressure cooker has one, or cook on high pressure for 10 minutes
  - When cooking is complete, naturally release the pressure for 2 minutes, then quick release the remaining pressure
  - If you like your black bean soup partially pureed, use an immersion blender in the inner pot of the pressure cooker for 5 to 20 seconds depending on how smooth you like it. Add more liquid if needed
  - Serve as-is or with toppings of your choice
