steps:
  - If you prefer crunchy zucchini squash, sauté sliced zucchini squash with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and set aside.
  - Sauté the Onion, Garlic, and Shallot (Flavor Enhancement Step) - Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Ensure to coat the oil over whole bottom of the pot. Add minced shallot and sliced onion, then sauté. Add a pinch of kosher salt and ground black pepper to season. Stir occasionally until slightly browned. Add minced garlic and stir for roughly 30 seconds until fragrant. Add sliced mushrooms, a pinch of dried oregano, a pinch of dried basil, and sliced zucchini squash (omit zucchini squash if you already sauteed them) and cook for another minute. Taste and adjust if necessary.
  - Deglaze and Create Pasta Sauce - Pour in a dash of sherry wine and deglaze the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Mix 1 cup of unsalted homemade chicken stock (or vegetable stock), 2 cups of water, 2 tablespoons of light soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of fish sauce, and 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce in the pot.
  - Pressure Cook the Pasta - Pour Penne in the sauce. Place 156 ml tomato paste on top of the pasta and mix (SEE NOTES). Test seasoning and adjust. Ensure all Penne are completely submerged in the sauce. Pressure cook at High Pressure for 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and wait 5 minutes before Quick Release.
  - Serve - Taste pasta, if you find them too hard, close lid and let the leftover heat cook them until desired doneness. If you have set aside some crunchy zucchini squash, now is the time to mix them in and serve immediately.
  - Add freshly grated Parmesan cheese to take it up a level.
