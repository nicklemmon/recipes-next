ingredients:
  - 2 teaspoon Nescafe Classic
  - 1 teaspoon sugar
  - ice cubes
steps:
  - Pour 10-15ml of water in the shaker (preferably not chilled, but chilled will still do).
  - Add two tea-spoonfuls of NESCAFÉ and one tea-spoonful of sugar, or more if desired.
  - Shake strongly until all the water becomes foam.3. Potential use of an electric hand mixer, instead of a shaker, will make a more nice, shiny and creamy foam.
  - Pour into a glass of 250ml, add 3-4 ice cubes and chilled water to fill the glass for black NESCAFÉ Frappé. For white NESCAFÉ Frappé, add 20-30ml chilled milk. Ideal serving temperature 10 degrees Celsius.
  - Enjoy your NESCAFÉ Frappé!
