ingredients:
  - 1/2 cup butter (softened)
  - 1 cup white sugar
  - 1 egg
  - 1 cup evaporated milk
  - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1/2 teaspoon salt
  - 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
  - 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
  - 1/2 cup butter (softened)
  - 1 cup confectioners' sugar
  - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
  - 1 cup marshmallow creme
steps:
  - Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.
  - To Make Cookie Crusts - In a large mixing bowl, cream together 1/2 cup butter or margarine and white sugar. Add egg, evaporated milk, and vanilla. Mix well. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, salt, cocoa powder, baking soda, and baking powder. Add flour mixture slowly to sugar mixture while stirring. Mix just until all ingredients are combined.
  - Drop the dough onto greased cookie sheet by rounded tablespoonfuls. Leave at least 3 inches in between each one; dough will spread as it bakes.
  - Bake in preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes, until firm when pressed with finger. Allow to cool at least one hour before filling.
  - To Make Marshmallow Filling - In a medium mixing bowl, blend together 1/2 cup butter or margarine, confectioners' sugar, flavored extract, and marshmallow creme. Mix until smooth. Assemble pies by spreading 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of filling on flat side of a cookie crust, then covering filling with flat side of another cookie crust.
