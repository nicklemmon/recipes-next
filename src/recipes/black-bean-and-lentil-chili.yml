ingredients:
  - 1.5 cups dry lentils
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 large onion
  - 1 large red pepper (diced)
  - 2 tablespoons minced garlic
  - 3 tablespoons chili powder
  - 2 teaspoons dried oregano
  - 1.5 teaspoons ground cumin
  - 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 29 ounces of canned tomatoes
  - 31 ounces of canned black beans
  - 1/2 cup of cilantro (chopped)
steps:
  - Place lentils in a large sauce pan and cover with water by several inches; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until lentils are tender but retain a little bite, about 10 to 15 minutes; drain well and set aside.
  - Meanwhile, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook onion, pepper and garlic, stirring often, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes.
  - In a cup, combine chili powder, oregano, cumin, cayenne and salt; add to skillet and stir well to combine. Cook, stirring often, about 1 minute.
  - Add tomatoes and their juice, and beans to skillet; stir well to combine. Cover skillet and simmer so flavors can blend, about 5 to 10 minutes. Fold in lentils and cilantro; serve. Yields about 1 cup per serving.
